im feeling quite sad and sorry for myself but ill snap out of it soon;sadness
i feel like i am still looking at a blank canvas blank pieces of paper;sadness
i feel like a faithful servant;love
i am just feeling cranky and blue;anger
i can have for a treat or if i am feeling festive;joy
i start to feel more appreciative of what god has done for me;joy
i am feeling more confident that we will be able to take care of this baby;joy
i feel incredibly lucky just to be able to talk to her;joy
i feel less keen about the army every day;joy
i feel dirty and ashamed for saying that;sadness
